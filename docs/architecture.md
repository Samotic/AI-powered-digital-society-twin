# Architecture Reference (v2, PROPOSED)

> **Status: PROPOSED**, awaiting instructor and team approval. Nothing is implemented yet.
>
> This is the **module and interface reference**. The reasoning behind each decision, the diagrams (system context, data flow, population generation, persona-to-agent activation, experiment lifecycle, deployment), and the MVP and roadmap are in the **[SocietyTwin v2 Architecture Report](societytwin-v2-architecture.md)**.
>
> The previous architecture (v1.0, a 5,000-agent demographic prototype comparing ABM, Cohort-Component / Matrix Projection, and ML models) is **SUPERSEDED** and archived in [archive/architecture-v1-demographic.md](archive/architecture-v1-demographic.md).

## 1. Layers

| Layer | Modules | Uses an LLM? |
|---|---|---|
| Data | `ingestion` | No |
| Population | `persona` (schema), `population`, `sampling` | No |
| Experiments | `scenarios`, `experiments`, `agents` | Only `agents` |
| Analysis | `evaluation`, `simulation` (optional) | No |
| Platform | `registry`, `api`, `frontend` | No |

**Dependency rule.** Population and analysis modules must not import web frameworks or LLM code, so that they can be tested and run on their own. Only `agents` talks to model providers. `api` contains no business logic: it validates requests and calls the other modules.

The current repository still has the research-phase placeholders under `src/`. They are **not** moved in this documentation change; see [migration-plan.md](migration-plan.md).

## 3. Module specifications

### `ingestion`
- **Purpose:** turn official downloads into validated, harmonised constraint tables.
- **Input:** files in `data/raw/`; entries in `data/manifest.yaml`.
- **Output:** harmonised marginals and cross-tabulations (Parquet) in `data/processed/`; an ingestion report.
- **Main responsibilities:** checksum and manifest checks; schema and value validation; geography mapping to İBBS codes; age-band, education, occupation, and sector harmonisation; reconciliation with ADNKS totals; marking held-out tables.
- **Dependencies:** pandas, PyArrow, Pydantic.
- **Testing:** artificial tables with known errors (missing cells, bad codes, inconsistent totals) must be reported; harmonisation mappings are round-trip tested.

### `persona`
- **Purpose:** define the versioned persona schema and render personas from records.
- **Input:** schema files in `configs/schema/`; population records.
- **Output:** schema objects (attributes, categories, parents, provenance, constraints); persona cards and unknowns statements.
- **Main responsibilities:** schema loading and validation; category encodings; hard-constraint definitions; template-based persona rendering; the synthetic-data label.
- **Dependencies:** Pydantic; a template engine.
- **Testing:** schema validation (acyclic DAG, known categories, valid constraints); rendering snapshots; no excluded attribute can appear in a card.

### `population`
- **Purpose:** generate population builds.
- **Input:** processed tables; schema version; N; seed.
- **Output:** a partitioned Parquet build and its build manifest.
- **Main responsibilities:** IPF fitting of conditionals; controlled-rounding allocation to province × sex × age cells; vectorised DAG-ordered sampling with masks; seeded streams per partition; writing builds.
- **Dependencies:** NumPy, pandas (small tables), PyArrow, `persona`, `registry`.
- **Testing:** IPF convergence on small tables; totals preserved; zero hard-constraint violations; same seed gives an identical checksum; independence from partition processing order (property-based tests).

### `sampling`
- **Purpose:** select reproducible cohorts from a build.
- **Input:** build ID; structured filter specification; sample size; sampling method; seed.
- **Output:** cohort manifest (requested and realised) with record IDs and inclusion weights.
- **Main responsibilities:** translate filters to DuckDB queries safely; simple random and stratified sampling; weight computation; realised subgroup counts.
- **Dependencies:** DuckDB, `registry`.
- **Testing:** same inputs give the same IDs; stratum sizes match the design; weights sum to the filtered population; invalid filters are rejected.

### `scenarios`
- **Purpose:** define versioned instruments and scenario conditions.
- **Input:** instrument files in `configs/instruments/`.
- **Output:** validated instrument objects with answer schemas; condition definitions (baseline and treatments).
- **Main responsibilities:** instrument validation; answer JSON schemas; random assignment of conditions with a seed; carrying the v1 demographic scenario parameters for the optional dynamics engine.
- **Dependencies:** Pydantic.
- **Testing:** instrument validation; condition assignment is balanced and reproducible.

### `experiments`
- **Purpose:** run experiments from configuration to results.
- **Input:** cohort; instrument and conditions; environment; model configuration; seeds; budget.
- **Output:** experiment manifest; trial records; lifecycle state.
- **Main responsibilities:** configuration validation and cost estimate; lifecycle (draft → validated → queued → running → completed / failed / stopped → analysed); SURVEY and SCENARIO environments (CHAT is STRETCH); trial orchestration through `agents`.
- **Dependencies:** `sampling`, `scenarios`, `agents`, `persona`, `registry`.
- **Testing:** end-to-end runs with the stub model; lifecycle transitions; budget stop; cancellation.

### `agents`
- **Purpose:** instantiate personas as AI agents for single trials.
- **Input:** persona card; instrument item and answer schema; prompt template version; model configuration.
- **Output:** a validated structured answer with usage information.
- **Main responsibilities:** provider-independent adapter interface; stub model; prompt templates (versioned); structured-output validation with bounded retries; asynchronous execution with concurrency limits; response cache; token and cost accounting; budget guard.
- **Dependencies:** provider SDKs or HTTP client (behind the adapter), Pydantic, `registry`.
- **Testing:** stub model only in CI; cache-key determinism; retry and invalid-output handling; no credentials in logs.

### `simulation` (optional, STRETCH)
- **Purpose:** population dynamics over records (aging, births, deaths, migration) and the Cohort-Component / Matrix Projection benchmark carried over from v1.
- **Input:** a build; TÜİK vital statistics and life tables; scenario parameters.
- **Output:** time-shifted builds; aggregate time series in the Common Result Schema.
- **Main responsibilities:** vectorised yearly transitions; accounting identity checks; docking against the cohort-component benchmark.

- **Input:** builds; processed and held-out tables; trial records.
- **Output:** validation reports; Common Result Schema aggregates; performance and cost summaries.
- **Main responsibilities:** TVD, JSD, MAE, RMSE, SRMSE, Cramér's V difference, constraint violation rate, rare-cell recall; persona-consistency and experiment-validity metrics; weighted subgroup estimates with intervals ([validation-strategy.md](validation-strategy.md)).
- **Dependencies:** NumPy, SciPy, DuckDB.
- **Testing:** metrics against hand-computed examples; edge cases (zero cells, single category).

### `registry`
- **Purpose:** provenance and job state.
- **Input:** manifests and status updates from other modules.
- **Output:** persisted build, cohort, and experiment records; job queue.
- **Main responsibilities:** manifest storage; job table with safe concurrent claiming; trial index; experiment history.
- **Dependencies:** PostgreSQL (SQLite for local development and tests).
- **Testing:** transactions; concurrent job claiming; migrations.

### `api`
- **Purpose:** expose the platform to the frontend.
- **Input:** HTTP requests.
- **Output:** JSON responses; job submissions; exports.
- **Main responsibilities:** the endpoints in [report §21](societytwin-v2-architecture.md#21-api-architecture); request validation; roles (if enabled); synthetic-data labels in responses.
- **Dependencies:** FastAPI, all modules above.
- **Testing:** contract tests with the FastAPI test client.

### `frontend`
